# Asteroid Evader
Asteroid Evader is a 2D dodge and survive game created using Python. I plan to increase the functionalities and scope of this game by 
giving it a story mode where users can progress through out the game with their custom profiles.

To play the game, download the folder and run the main.py file. You should ensure that you have Python/Pygame installed on your computer.
